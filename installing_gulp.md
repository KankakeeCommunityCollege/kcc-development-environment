# Installing Gulpjs

Gulp requires both a global installation of the `gulp-cli` and local installation of `gulp` in your project.

## Install the gulp-cli

```bash
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

## Install in the project

**When you run `sh install.sh`, `npm install` gets called. This will install gulp from the `package.json`'s `devDependencies`**
